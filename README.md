### 5.2.2 Back-End of SLAM

In the above summarised Optical Flow, we have obtained the pixel motion. The ego-motion estimation we discussed here focuses on explicitly regressing the 6-DOF motion from event data through an end-to-end trainable pipeline. In traditional SLAM, we can easily estimate depth and ego motion through triangulation and the followed local pose estimation e.g. PnP. When adopting a learning-based approach, the optical flow, depth and ego-motion estimation usually be united in single, consistent frameworks, which provides an opportunity for dense mapping in the SLAM system. 

#### 5.2.2.1 Ego-motion estimation

CVPR and IROS present the united framework for optical flow, depth and ego-motion estimation. The recent EAGAN adopting Transformer to boost the performance of optical flow task to SOTA, yet no optimization is done to depth estimation. Moreover, the network show increse in parameter while the motion estimation is even kicked out of the network.
